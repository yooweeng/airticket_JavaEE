      <h2> The Best Time To Travel To Spain 
          <br/>
          <br/> September to November is easily one of the best times to travel to Spain. 
          <br/> The 500-year-old trees in Faedo de Cinera change their leaves to beautiful
          <br/> autumnal colors. Plan your trip for September, and you can test the year's
          <br/> wine harvest! Head up to Rioja and Ribera for some of the best wine tastings
          <br/> in Spain! June to August is the most popular time to visit Spain. The weather
          <br/> is perfect for long days on the country's 5,000 miles of coastline.

                            <h3> Salamanca Plaza Mayor <br/>#1</h3>
                            <p class="tm-margin-b-20">Built between 1729 and 1755, Salamanca's exceptional grand 
                            square is widely considered to be Spain's most beautiful central plaza. It's particularly 
                            memorable at night when illuminated (until midnight) to magical effect. 
                            Designed by Alberto Churriguera, it's a remarkably harmonious and controlled 
                            baroque display. The medallions placed around the square bear the busts of famous figures.

                            into whitewashed Spanish plazas and Roman ruins. As one of Europe's oldest cities, it has the 
                            feel of an urban island, marked almost entirely by beaches and ultramarine harbours dotted with 
                            fishing boats.

                            restaurants with world cuisine or unbeatable nightlife, Madrid will surprise you with its charming, 
                            tranquil historic spots, with traditional and family-run century-old bars where friends meet up for a 
                            drink, all kinds of neighbourhoods, and cultural centres that offer an alternative type of tourism.

                            <p class="tm-margin-b-20">The city of Pamplona is world-famous for its fiestas of San Fermin Festival. 
                            Thousands of people go there every year to experience the risk and the thrill of the running of the 
                            bulls, a tradition immortalised by Ernest Hemingway in his novel Fiesta. Over nine days, dressed in 
                            traditional red and white costumes, locals and visitors give themselves over to the festive spirit.
